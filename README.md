# #Bible-bot

A discord bot that allows for a daily verse to be sent. Currently, the verse is setup to be sent at 8:30AM EST. This will later be changed to a command that will
allow you to schedule the time. I have implemented a /verse and /random. /verse lets you specify the book, chapter, and verse that would like to see. Optional you can
provide a translation that is checked and used. /random send and completely random verse from the bible. This is a passion project that I will develop overtime.
